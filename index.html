        Game of Life:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Game of Life was my first big project (Made in C++ and wxWidgets). Game of Life was a concept created by the mathmatician John Conway.
        Rules - Any living cell in the current universe with less than 2 living neighbors
        dies in the next generation as if by under-population. If a cell meets this criteria in the universe array then
        make the same cell dead. Any living cell with more than 3 living neighbors will die in
        the next generation as if by over-population. If so in the universe then kill it. Any living
        cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors will live on into the next generation. If this is the case in the universe then
        the same cell lives. Any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors will be born into the next
        generation as if by reproduction. If so in the universe then make that cell alive.
        My biggest obstacle with this project was implementing the rules they took me far too long to get correct and by the time
        I had finally gotten them right I had fallen pretty far behind, but I learned something quite valueable which is that no
        matter how difficult things get you should not quit until the whistle has blown.

        Mystery Hotel:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Mystery Hotel was my team and I's project for mid-term (Made in C# and Unity). Premise - You are trapped in a hotel with various enimies
        and you need to try and escape to the roof where a helicopter is waiting to bring you to safety. My biggest take away
        from this project was communication is key when doing absolutely anythin because it could affect the work of another team-mate.

        Movie Search Application:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Next, I choose to make a movie search app in TypeScript and React. This application fetches movie information and images from
        API's. You are able to look at the most popular movies, new releases, browse by various genres, search, and advanced search.
        Once you click on a movie it displays that movies card which contains all relevant information about the movie. My biggest
        struggles with this project were learning a new language, making a website, and the advanced search functionality in about 
        a month which I mainly overcame from watching many YouTube tutorials, but I was fill with euphoria once it was complete.
        What I learned was that I am capable of learning and adapting to new concepts rather quickly if I put my mind to it.
