        Game of Life
    </h2>
    <p class="story text-base">
        Game of Life, my first major project, was developed using C++ and wxWidgets. Created by mathematician John Conway, this 
        cellular automaton follows specific rules for cell survival and reproduction. The rules are as follows: a living cell with 
        fewer than two living neighbors dies from underpopulation; a living cell with more than three living neighbors dies from 
        overpopulation; a living cell with two or three living neighbors survives; and a dead cell with exactly three living 
        neighbors becomes alive. Implementing these rules was my biggest challenge, requiring extensive debugging and testing to 
        ensure accuracy. Through perseverance, I overcame this hurdle, learning that dedication is critical until a project is 
        complete.

        Mystery Hotel
    </h2>
    <p class="story text-base">
        Mystery Hotel, a midterm team project built in C# and Unity, challenges players to escape a hotel filled with enemies to 
        reach a helicopter on the roof. My responsibilities included designing Level 3, creating the kill floor mechanic, developing
        the Scorched Annihilator enemy, implementing settings, and performing various bug fixes. The project taught me the 
        importance of clear communication, as missteps could impact teammates’ work. Through collaborative testing and iteration,
        we delivered a functional game.

        Movie Search Application
    </h2>
    <p class="story text-base">
        For my Project and Portfolio IV, I developed a movie search application using TypeScript and React. This app fetches movie 
        data and images from APIs, allowing users to explore popular films, new releases, genres, and advanced search features. 
        Clicking a movie displays detailed information. Learning TypeScript, building a responsive website, and implementing 
        advanced search within a month were significant challenges. By studying YouTube tutorials, I overcame these obstacles, 
        gaining confidence in my ability to quickly adapt to new technologies.

        AquaDex
    </h2>
    <p class="story text-base">
        AquaDex, my final project at Full Sail, is a marine life index that stores species data, including habitat, diet, 
        location, and endangered status. Users can browse by species, region, or conservation status, view conservation measures,
        and search using partial input. The database was initially populated using API Ninjas’ animals API and enhanced with custom
        web scrapers I developed. Creating moderately complex web scrapers was challenging but rewarding, as it deepened my 
        technical skills and problem-solving abilities.
