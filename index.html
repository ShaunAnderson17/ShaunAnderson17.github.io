        Game of Life:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Game of Life was my first big project (Made in C++ and wxWidgets). The Game of Life is a concept created by the
        mathematician John Conway. 
        Rules: 
        Any living cell in the current universe with fewer than 2 living neighbors dies in the next generation due to 
        under-population. If a cell meets this criterion in the universe array, it is marked as dead. Any living cell with 
        more than 3 living neighbors will die in the next generation due to over-population. If this condition exists in the 
        universe, the cell is killed. Any living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors will survive into the next generation. 
        If this condition exists in the universe, the cell remains alive. Any dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors will 
        be born into the next generation due to reproduction. If this condition exists in the universe, that cell is made alive. 
        My biggest obstacle with this project was implementing the rules, which took me far too long to get correct. By the time
        I finally got them right, I had fallen pretty far behind. However, I learned something quite valuable: no matter how 
        difficult things get, you should not quit until the whistle has blown.

        Mystery Hotel:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Mystery Hotel was my team's midterm project (made in C# and Unity). The premise: You are trapped in a hotel with 
        various enemies, and you need to try to escape to the roof where a helicopter is waiting to bring you to safety. My
        biggest takeaway from this project was that communication is key in absolutely anything because it could affect the
        work of another teammate.

        Movie Search Application:
    </h2>
    <p class="story">
        Next, I chose to create a movie search app in TypeScript and React. This application fetches movie information
        and images from APIs. You can explore the most popular movies, new releases, browse by various genres, perform searches,
        and use advanced search features. Clicking on a movie displays its card containing all relevant information. My biggest
        challenges with this project were learning a new language, building a website, and implementing advanced search 
        functionality within a month. I mainly overcame these challenges by watching many YouTube tutorials. However, I was filled
        with euphoria once it was complete. What I learned is that I am capable of learning and adapting to new concepts rather 
        quickly if I put my mind to it.
